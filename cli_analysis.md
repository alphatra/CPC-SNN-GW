# CLI Folder Analysis

## 🚨 **DUPLICATES FOUND!**

### Major Duplication Issues:

1. **`cli.py` (1874 lines) vs `cli/` folder**
   - `cli.py` contains FULL implementation (train_cmd, eval_cmd, infer_cmd)
   - `cli/main.py` has SAME main() function
   - `cli/commands/train.py` has SAME train_cmd()
   - `cli/commands/evaluate.py` has SAME eval_cmd()
   - `cli/commands/inference.py` has SAME infer_cmd()
   - `cli/parsers/base.py` has SAME get_base_parser()

2. **This is REDUNDANT** - we have 2 complete implementations:
   - Old monolithic: `cli.py` (1874 lines)
   - New modular: `cli/` folder structure

## 📁 Current Structure:

```
cli.py                    ❌ DUPLICATE - Old monolithic version (1874 lines)
cli/
├── __init__.py          ✅ Package init
├── main.py              ✅ Modular entry point
├── commands/            ✅ Modular commands
│   ├── train.py         ✅ Training command
│   ├── evaluate.py      ✅ Evaluation command
│   ├── inference.py     ✅ Inference command
│   └── training/        ✅ Training submodules
│       ├── data_loader.py
│       ├── enhanced.py
│       ├── initializer.py
│       └── standard.py
├── parsers/             ✅ Argument parsers
│   └── base.py          ✅ Base parser
├── runners/             ✅ Training runners

```

## 🔍 Usage Analysis:

Checking which version is actually used:

1. **Entry points** (from pyproject.toml or scripts):
   - Need to check which one is the actual entry point
   
2. **Imports from other modules**:
   - Most imports reference functions directly, not from specific files

## ❌ **Files to Remove:**

### Option 1: Keep Modular (RECOMMENDED)
- **DELETE:** `cli.py` (1874 lines of duplicate code)
- **KEEP:** `cli/` folder structure
- **UPDATE:** Entry points to use `cli.main:main`

### Option 2: Keep Monolithic (NOT recommended)
- **DELETE:** Entire `cli/` folder
- **KEEP:** `cli.py`
- **LOSE:** Better organization and modularity

## 🎯 **Recommendation:**

**DELETE `cli.py`** and keep the modular `cli/` structure because:
1. Better code organization
2. Easier maintenance
3. Already split into logical components
4. Follows best practices

## 📝 **Required Actions:**

1. Delete `cli.py`
2. Update any imports that reference `cli.py` directly
3. Update entry points in `pyproject.toml`
4. Test that CLI still works
