Spike encoding strategies for bridge module.

This module contains various spike encoding implementations extracted from
spike_bridge.py for better modularity:
- TemporalContrastEncoder: Temporal difference-based encoding
- LearnableMultiThresholdEncoder: Adaptive multi-threshold encoding  
- PhasePreservingEncoder: Phase-preserving encoding for GW signals

Split from spike_bridge.py for better maintainability.
