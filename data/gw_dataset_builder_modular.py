"""
GW Dataset Builder (MODULAR)

This file delegates to modular dataset builder components for better maintainability.
The actual implementation has been split into:
- builders/core.py: GWDatasetBuilder
- builders/factory.py: Factory functions
- builders/testing.py: Test utilities

This file maintains backward compatibility through delegation.
