# Performance Analysis

## GPU Optimization

The system's performance on GPU hardware is optimized through a comprehensive 6-stage warmup procedure, which is a critical innovation for ensuring stable and efficient execution. This warmup is automatically applied at the start of any training or evaluation run via the `cli.py` and `enhanced_cli.py` entry points.


The 6-stage warmup progressively initializes the GPU's CUDA kernels by executing operations of increasing complexity and memory footprint. The stages are as follows:

1.  **Basic Tensor Operations**: Simple arithmetic and linear algebra (e.g., `jnp.sum`, `jnp.dot`) with small tensors.
2.  **Model-Specific Dense Layer Operations**: Simulated forward passes through dense layers with typical input and weight matrix sizes.
3.  **CPC/SNN Temporal Operations**: Operations involving sequence data, such as temporal shifts and similarity calculations on latent features.
4.  **Advanced CUDA Kernels**: Convolutional operations using `jax.lax.conv_general_dilated`, which are common in the model's architecture.
5.  **JAX JIT Compilation**: A warmup of the Just-In-Time compiler with a representative function to pre-compile the computational graph.
6.  **SpikeBridge/CPC Specific Operations**: The most complex, model-specific operations, such as the multi-layer convolutions used in the Spike Bridge.

This progressive initialization eliminates the "Delay kernel timed out" CUDA warnings that were a major source of instability in earlier versions. By the end of the warmup, all necessary kernels are resident in GPU memory, ensuring smooth and predictable performance throughout the training process.


## Memory Management

Memory management is a paramount concern for this system, given the large size of gravitational wave datasets and the computational demands of the model. The system employs several strategies to operate efficiently within the constraints of T4/V100 GPUs (16-64GB VRAM).

The primary strategy is the use of a very small batch size, typically `batch_size=1`. This drastically reduces the peak memory footprint during training, as gradients and intermediate activations are computed for only a single sample at a time. To compensate for the statistical noise introduced by a small batch size, the system implements gradient accumulation. This technique accumulates gradients over multiple forward passes before applying a single update to the model's weights, effectively simulating a larger batch size while maintaining low memory usage.

The system also configures JAX's XLA compiler with conservative memory settings. The environment variables `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false` and `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.15` are set to prevent the XLA runtime from pre-allocating the entire GPU memory, which can lead to swapping and system instability. This allows the system to coexist with other processes and provides a more predictable memory profile.


## Training Efficiency

The training efficiency of the CPC-SNN-GW system is a result of the synergistic interaction between its architectural components and optimization techniques.

The self-supervised nature of the CPC pre-training phase allows the model to learn powerful representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data, which significantly reduces the amount of labeled data required for the final SNN classification task. This is a major efficiency gain, as labeling real gravitational wave data is a labor-intensive process.


The use of Spiking Neural Networks for the final classification provides a substantial energy efficiency advantage. SNNs are inherently event-driven; neurons only consume significant computational resources when they fire a spike. For sparse signals like gravitational waves, which are brief perturbations in a sea of noise, this results in dramatically lower energy consumption compared to traditional deep learning models that process every time step continuously.

The combination of the 6-stage GPU warmup, small batch size with gradient accumulation, and efficient JAX/XLA configuration ensures that the training process is not only stable but also achieves a high throughput. The system is designed to meet the performance target of <100ms inference time per 4-second segment, making it suitable for real-time or near-real-time gravitational wave detection applications.
