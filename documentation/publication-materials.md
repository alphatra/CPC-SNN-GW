## Key Figures and Visualizations

The following figures are recommended for inclusion in a publication to effectively communicate the system's architecture and results:

1.  **System Architecture Diagram**: A high-level diagram illustrating the complete data flow, from raw LIGO strain data through the CPC encoder, Spike Bridge, and SNN classifier, to the final detection output. This should highlight the integration of self-supervised and neuromorphic components.
2.  **ROC Curve**: A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve comparing the performance of the CPC-SNN-GW system against the PyCBC matched-filtering baseline and other deep learning approaches (if available) on the same test dataset. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) should be clearly labeled.
3.  **Training Curves**: Plots showing the training and validation loss (including the CPC loss and classification loss) and accuracy over the course of the 10 epochs. This demonstrates the stability and convergence of the training process.
4.  **Inference Speed and Energy Comparison**: A bar chart comparing the inference speed (ms per segment) and estimated energy consumption (Joules per detection) of the CPC-SNN-GW system against PyCBC and a standard deep learning model (e.g., a CNN). This visually emphasizes the system's efficiency advantages.
5.  **Example Signal Detection**: A time-series plot showing a segment of real LIGO strain data, with the true signal location marked, and the model's predicted probability of a signal over time. This provides an intuitive understanding of the model's decision-making process.

## Supplementary Materials

The following materials should be made available as supplementary data to ensure full reproducibility:

*   **Complete Source Code**: The entire codebase, including all scripts, modules, and configuration files, hosted on a public repository (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo).
*   **Trained Model Weights**: The final model checkpoint (e.g., `model_params.pkl`) from a representative training run.
*   **Configuration Files**: The exact YAML configuration files used for the experiments.
*   **Data Processing Scripts**: Any scripts used to create the final dataset from the raw HDF5 files.
*   **Raw Results**: The complete `training.log` file and any generated TensorBoard or W&B logs.

## Target Journals

The following high-impact journals are recommended for submission, given the interdisciplinary nature of the work:

*   **Nature Astronomy**: For its broad readership in astrophysics and focus on groundbreaking observational techniques.
*   **Physical Review Letters (PRL)**: The premier journal for rapid communication of significant physics results, including gravitational wave discoveries.
*   **Nature Machine Intelligence**: For its focus on the intersection of AI and real-world scientific applications.
*   **The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ)**: A leading journal in astrophysics, with a strong tradition in gravitational wave research.
*   **IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems**: For its focus on novel neural network architectures and their applications.
