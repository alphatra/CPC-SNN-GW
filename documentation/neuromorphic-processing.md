## Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) form the core classification engine of the CPC-SNN-GW system, providing a biologically-inspired, event-driven approach to signal detection. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks that process information continuously, SNNs communicate via discrete spikes, mimicking the behavior of biological neurons. This paradigm offers significant advantages in energy efficiency and computational speed, making it ideal for real-time processing of sparse gravitational wave signals.

The SNN classifier in this system is implemented using the LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) neuron model, a standard and computationally efficient model that captures the essential dynamics of neuronal firing. The network architecture is designed for high capacity, featuring 4 layers with 512, 256, 128, and 64 neurons respectively. This depth allows the network to learn complex, hierarchical representations of the input features.

A key innovation is the use of an enhanced LIF model with refractory period and adaptation mechanisms. The refractory period prevents a neuron from firing immediately after a spike, adding biological realism and temporal dynamics. Adaptation allows the neuron's firing threshold to increase with sustained activity, which helps prevent runaway excitation and improves the network's stability during prolonged input.

## Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)

Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) is employed as a self-supervised learning method to extract meaningful, high-level representations from the raw, unlabeled gravitational wave strain data. The primary goal of the CPC encoder is to learn a latent space where the model can predict future time steps in a sequence based on past context, thereby capturing the underlying temporal structure of the signal.

The CPC encoder processes the input time-series data through a series of convolutional and recurrent operations to generate a sequence of latent features. The core of the CPC loss function is the Temporal InfoNCE (Noise Contrastive Estimation) objective. This loss function works by contrasting a true future target (a positive sample) against a large number of negative samples (randomly selected from other time steps or sequences). The model is trained to assign a high similarity score to the positive pair and low scores to the negative pairs.

A critical technical achievement in this implementation is the `calculate_fixed_cpc_loss` function, which resolves the issue of a zero loss value that plagued earlier versions. This function is batch-agnostic and works robustly even with a batch size of 1, which is necessary for memory-constrained environments. It achieves this by properly shifting the context and target features in time and applying L2 normalization for numerical stability.

## Spike Bridge

The Spike Bridge is a crucial component that acts as a transducer between the continuous representations produced by the CPC encoder and the discrete spike trains required by the SNN classifier. This module is responsible for the neuromorphic conversion of the data.

The primary encoding scheme used is Temporal-Contrast encoding, which is a significant improvement over the simpler Poisson encoding. Temporal-Contrast encoding preserves the phase and frequency information of the input signal by generating spikes based on the rate of change (contrast) of the input over time. This is particularly important for gravitational wave signals, which have specific phase evolution characteristics that are critical for detection.

The Spike Bridge is designed with validation to ensure the integrity of the conversion process. It includes checks to validate the input features and can handle edge cases gracefully. The module is also optimized for performance, with its operations designed to be efficiently compiled by JAX's JIT compiler.

The successful integration of the Spike Bridge with the CPC encoder and SNN classifier creates a complete neuromorphic pipeline. The system first learns robust, self-supervised features from the raw data (CPC), converts these features into a spike-based representation (Spike Bridge), and finally performs energy-efficient classification (SNN), achieving a state-of-the-art balance between detection performance and computational efficiency.
