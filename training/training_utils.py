"""
Training Utils (MODULAR)

This file delegates to modular training utility components for better maintainability.
The actual implementation has been split into:
- utils/setup.py: Environment and logging setup
- utils/optimization.py: JAX optimization and caching
- utils/monitoring.py: Memory and gradient monitoring  
- utils/training.py: Core training support functions

This file maintains backward compatibility through delegation.
