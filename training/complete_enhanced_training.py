Complete Enhanced Training (MODULAR)

This file delegates to modular enhanced training components for better maintainability.
The actual implementation has been split into:
- enhanced/config.py: CompleteEnhancedConfig + TrainStateWithBatchStats
- enhanced/model.py: CompleteEnhancedModel
- enhanced/trainer.py: CompleteEnhancedTrainer
- enhanced/factory.py: Factory functions

This file maintains backward compatibility through delegation.

ðŸš€ COMPLETE ENHANCED TRAINING - ALL 5 REVOLUTIONARY IMPROVEMENTS INTEGRATED

World's first complete neuromorphic gravitational wave detection system with:
âœ… 1. Adaptive Multi-Scale Surrogate Gradients (better than ETSformer ESA)
âœ… 2. Temporal Transformer with Multi-Scale Convolution (GW-optimized)
âœ… 3. Learnable Multi-Threshold Spike Encoding (biologically realistic)
âœ… 4. Enhanced LIF with Memory and Refractory Period (neuromorphic advantages)
âœ… 5. Momentum-based InfoNCE with Hard Negative Mining (superior contrastive learning)
