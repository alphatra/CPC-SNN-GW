Advanced Training (MODULAR)

This file delegates to modular advanced training components for better maintainability.
The actual implementation has been split into:
- advanced/attention.py: AttentionCPCEncoder 
- advanced/snn_deep.py: DeepSNN + LIFLayer
- advanced/trainer.py: RealAdvancedGWTrainer + factory

This file maintains backward compatibility through delegation.
